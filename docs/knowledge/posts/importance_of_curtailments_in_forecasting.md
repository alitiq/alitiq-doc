# Why Understanding Curtailments and Unavailabilities Matters for Power Forecasting ‚ö°üå¨Ô∏è

In the quest for accurate wind power forecasting, there's one reality that often gets in the way: **real-world power output does not always reflect the full capacity of your wind turbines** or **pv systems**. This discrepancy is frequently caused by *curtailments* and *unavailabilities*.

<!-- more -->

At **alitiq**, we prioritize forecasting based on **true system potential**, not reduced or distorted generation. Here's why it matters ‚Äî and what we do to ensure our forecasts are always a true representation of full operational availability.

## What Are Curtailments and Unavailabilities?  

### Curtailments  
Curtailments refer to **intentional reductions** in wind power output. This can be due to:
- Grid constraints  
- Market signals  
- Maintenance needs  
- Safety or compliance regulations

Even though the wind is blowing and the turbines could produce energy, they‚Äôre **instructed not to**.

### Unavailabilities  
Unavailabilities are **unplanned or planned outages** in renewable energy generation:
- Turbine failures
- Inverter failures
- Scheduled maintenance
- Communication breakdowns  
- Sensor issues or data gaps
- Damage due to severe weather

These events result in **zero or reduced output**, but not because of environmental or performance limitations.

## Why Forecasting Needs Clean Training Data  

If we trained our forecasting models on raw generation data that includes curtailments or unavailabilities, the results would be:
- **Underestimated forecasts**, because the model "learns" that the site often produces less than potential.
- **Erroneous correlations**, where the model mistakenly attributes reductions to weather or other valid features.
- **Poor generalization**, especially when turbines or pv system return to full service.

## alitiq‚Äôs Approach: Always Forecasting 100% Availability  

At alitiq, we **mask** curtailed or unavailable data in our training pipeline. This ensures that:
- Our models only learn from **valid, fully available** system behavior.  
- Forecasts reflect **what the system *could* produce**, not what it *did* produce under constraints.  
- You get a forecast for **ideal availability**, giving operators a baseline to measure performance, efficiency, or lost revenue.

This approach allows for:
- More **reliable capacity planning**  
- Better **grid interaction** and reserve allocation  
- Accurate **performance benchmarking**

## How You Can Help Improve Forecast Accuracy  

To get the best from your forecasts, we recommend:
1. **Reporting curtailments**: Use our `/curtailments/add/` endpoint to provide structured curtailment data. It exists both for wind and solar.
2. **Marking unavailabilities**: Let us know when turbines or the pv system are out of service.
3. **Pushing complete measurement data**: Even historical values can improve learning.

By integrating curtailments and unavailabilities into your data pipeline, you're actively contributing to **cleaner, smarter forecasts**.

## Conclusion  

Forecasting isn‚Äôt just about knowing the solar irradiance or the wind ‚Äî it‚Äôs about understanding when your system isn‚Äôt playing at full strength.

At alitiq, we‚Äôre committed to providing **100% availability forecasts** that you can rely on. Masking curtailments and unavailabilities is just one of the many ways we make our predictions smarter, fairer, and more actionable.
