# Pushing Measurements to the alitiq Load API ðŸ“Š  

This guide explains how to push measurements from a Solar PV power plant to the alitiq Solar API. Measurements are critical for enhancing forecast accuracy and for monitoring performance.  

---

## Overview  

The alitiq Load API allows you to submit real-time or historical measurement data from your load timeseries. Each measurement includes details about the time of recording, power/load, and additional optional information like irradiance.  

### Key Features âœ¨  
- **Real-time Measurements**: Submit live data for improved forecast accuracy.  
- **Historical Measurements**: Push past data for performance analysis and enhanced forecasting.  
- **Flexible Time Intervals**: Define custom intervals for measurements (e.g., 15 minutes).

## Required Measurement Data  

When pushing measurements, you need to include the following information:  

| **Field**            | **Type**         | **Description**                                                   | **Default**    |  
|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|  
| `location_id`         | `str`           | Unique ID of the location where the measurement was recorded.     | None           |  
| `dt`                 | `datetime`      | Timestamp of the measurement (ISO 8601 format).                   | None           |  
| `power`              | `float`         | Power output recorded (in specified unit).                        | None           |  
| `power_measure`      | `str`           | Unit of power measurement (`kW`, `W`, etc.).                      | `kW`           |  
| `timezone`           | `str`           | Timezone of the measurement timestamp. Available timezones can be found **[here](https://docs.alitiq.com/utils/timezones/)**                                | `UTC`          |  
| `interval_in_minutes` | `int`           | Interval between measurement timestamps (in minutes). Important to derive your data into MW which is the default in our database                    | `15`           |  
| `window_boundary`    | `str`           | Defines the interval's alignment (`begin`, `center`, or `end`).   | `end`          |  

### Detailed explanation: 
* `timezone`: Specify the timezone of your data. Common options include:
  * Europe/Berlin (includes daylight saving time)
  * Etc/GMT-1 (standard time, no daylight saving)
  * UTC (default)
* `window_boundary`: Define where the timestamp is located within the time window. Options are:
  * begin
  * center
  * end (default)
* `power_measure`: Specify the SI unit of your data. Available options are:
  * W
  * kW
  * MW (default)
  * MWh
  * kWh
  * Wh
* `interval_in_minutes`: Define the time interval between measurements. This is especially important if your data is in energy units rather than power.

## Note on Historical Measurements  

To provide highly optimized forecasts, the API requires at least 90 days of historical measurement data for a given load timeseries. This data enables the system to fine-tune forecasts to match the unique characteristics of your setup.  This data needs to updated once per day for the last 24 hours. In case of diurnal updates, alitiq will adapt the forecast tot the latest observations every 15 minutes.

## Example Code to Push Measurements  

Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating how to submit measurement data using the `measurement/add/` endpoint and the python-SDK method `post_measurements`:

## API Response  

- A successful request will return a confirmation message indicating the data was received and processed.  
- If there are validation errors (e.g., missing fields, incorrect formats), the API will return an error message with details.  

---

## Notes 

### Best Practices  

- **Batch Submissions**: Push multiple measurements in a single API call for efficiency.  
- **Time Synchronization**: Ensure timestamps (`dt`) are accurate and in the correct timezone. By defining `timezone`, `interval_in_minutes` and `window_boundary` we ask you to deal with it. 
- **Validation**: Use the SDK's `LoadMeasurementForm` for automatic data validation.

### Interval in minutes

The interval is important for measure transform into power (MW is default in alitiq's internal databases). Please take care that your data is aligned with the interval that you configure. 

### Window - boundary

It is important that you know where your timestamp is bounded. It can make a huge difference and will lead to timeshifts in the forecast. 
You maybe more familiar with pandas timestamp labels, so here we have mapping and a further explaination. In the future we will maybe allow for both. The examples refer to a quarter-hourly time interval:

- `begin` : `left` -> Timestamp 16:00 represents data from 16:00 to 16:15
- `center` : `center` -> Timestamp 16:07:30 represents data from 16:00 to 16:15
- `end` : `right` -> Timestamp 16:15 represents data from 16:00 to 16:15 (default in alitiq's databases)
