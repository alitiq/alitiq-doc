# How to Inspect Measurement Data with the alitiq Windpower API üîç  

The alitiq Wind API provides powerful tools to inspect and analyze the historical measurement data for your Windpark. This feature allows you to validate submitted data, track windpark performance, and gain insights into your portfolio.  

---

## Overview  

Inspecting data involves retrieving historical measurement records stored in the alitiq database for a specific Windpark (aka location). You can define a time range, customize the output format, and perform detailed analysis on the retrieved data.

---

## Key Features ‚ú®  

- **Flexible Time Ranges**: Retrieve data for any specified date range.  
- **Detailed Records**: Includes power output, timestamps, and optional irradiance values.  
- **Analysis Ready**: Data is returned in a format suitable for direct analysis using tools like pandas.  

!!! note "Data displayed as it is in alitiq's database"

    The data in our database is in timezone UTC, with end timestamp in kW power.

## Required Parameters  

To inspect data, provide the following information:  

| **Parameter**   | **Type**          | **Description**                                                   | **Default**              |  
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|  
| `location_id`    | `str`            | Unique identifier of the location whose data you want to inspect. | None                     |  
| `start_date`     | `datetime` (Optional) | Start date for the inspection range.                              | 2 days before today      |  
| `end_date`       | `datetime` (Optional) | End date for the inspection range.                                | Today                    |

## Example: Inspect Data  

Below is an example of how to use the `measurement/inspect/` endpoint to inspect data and the method `get_measurements`:  


=== "python requests"

    ``` python
    import requests
    
    url = "https://api.alitiq.com/wind/measurement/inspect/"
    
    querystring = {"location_id":"WP123","response_format":"json"}
    
    payload = ""
    headers = {"x-api-key": "api-key"}
    
    response = requests.request("GET", url, data=payload, headers=headers, params=querystring)
    
    print(response.text)
    ```

=== "alitiq-py"

    ``` python
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    from alitiq import alitiqWindAPI
    
    # Initialize the API client
    wind_api = alitiqWindAPI(api_key="your-api-key")
    
    # Define the location and date range
    location_id = "WP123"
    start_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)  # 7 days ago
    end_date = datetime.now()  # Today
    
    # Inspect measurement data
    data = wind_api.get_measurements(
        location_id=location_id, 
        start_date=start_date, 
        end_date=end_date
    )
    
    # Print the retrieved data
    print(data)
    ```

=== "cURL"

    ``` bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url 'https://api.alitiq.com/wind/measurement/inspect/?location_id=123&response_format=json' \
      --header 'x-api-key: api-key'
    ```

## API Response  

The API returns the measurement data in a pandas-compatible format (e.g., JSON), which can be directly loaded into a DataFrame for further analysis:  

```plaintext
|       dt        |   power   |  
|-----------------|-----------|
| 2024-06-10 10:00|  2120.5    | 
| 2024-06-10 10:15|  2090.8    | 
| 2024-06-10 10:30|  2150.0    |
```  

---

## Best Practices  

- **Validate Data**: Regularly inspect your measurement data to ensure it is accurate and complete.  
- **Batch Analysis**: Retrieve data in chunks for longer periods to avoid API response size limitations.  
- **Timezone Awareness**: Ensure the `timezone` is consistent across measurements for accurate analysis.  

---

## Advanced Use Case: Data Visualization  

You can use tools like `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to visualize the data for insights:  

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Visualize power output over time
data.plot(x='dt', y='power', title="Power Output Over Time", figsize=(10, 6))
plt.show()
```  

---

## Notes  

- **Performance**: For large datasets, limit the date range to improve response time.  
- **Missing Data**: If any data points are missing, double-check your measurement submissions.  
- **Data Validation**: The SDK validates data upon submission to minimize errors during inspection.
