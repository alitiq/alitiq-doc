# Solar-PV power forecasting locations

Welcome to the **alitiq Solar Power Forecasting API**! This guide explains how to create a location for a PV power plant, including subsystems for each unique combination of **azimuth** and **tilt**.  

---

## Key Concepts üìö  

In the alitiq Solar API, a **PV power plant** is represented as a location with one or more **subsystems**. Each subsystem corresponds to a unique configuration of azimuth and tilt of the PV modules. By defining these subsystems, the API ensures precise forecasting for the entire power plant.  


### Subsystems  
- A **subsystem** is defined by:  
  - **Azimuth**: Orientation of the module relative to true north (in degrees, South 180¬∞).  
  - **Tilt**: Angle of the module from the horizontal plane (in degrees).  
  - **Power Capacity**: Installed capacity of the modules in the subsystem (in kW).  
  - **installed_power**: The capacity of all modules per subsystem in the power plant.  
  - **inverter_power**: The capacity of the inverters per subsystem in the power plant.  


- Each unique combination of azimuth and tilt requires a separate subsystem for accurate forecasting.

## Add a new PV systems to your portfolio üöÄ  

To add a new location to your portfolio, you have to use the `pv_systems/add/` endpoint.

    ``` python
    import requests

!!! note

    After you have created your first or new pv system, it takes up to 6 hours to receive a first forecast under `optimized`. When you do not provide measurement data, the `optimized` is just a baseline forecast. No optimisation was done int htat case. Baseline forecast under `icon_eu` or `icon_global` is available with a delay of 5 minutes after creation.
    Optimized forecast are available the next day in case you have provided measurement data from the system.

#### Tracking system

Tracking systems are more advanced components in PV system modeling and require additional configuration details to accurately simulate system behavior.

The supported tracking types are:

* **No Tracking**: `0` or `1`
* **Single Axis Tracking (Vertical Axis)**: `2`
  *(Note: This is very rare and currently not supported.)*
* **Single Axis Tracking (Horizontal Axis)**: `3`
  *(This is the most common type.)*
* **Dual Axis Tracking**: `4`
  *(Rare, but supported.)*

##### Dual Axis Tracking

For dual-axis systems, no additional geometric parameters are needed. The modules follow the sun's position in both azimuth and zenith, offering optimal irradiance capture throughout the day.

##### Single Axis Tracking

For horizontal single-axis tracking systems (type `3`), the following parameters must be provided:

* **`table_length`**: Length of the PV table (in meters)

* **`height`**: Height of the rotation axis of the pv table (in metres)

* **`row_distance`**: Distance between adjacent tracker rows (in meters)
  These two parameters are used to calculate the *Ground Coverage Ratio (GCR)*.

* **`do_backtracking`**: Boolean flag indicating whether backtracking is enabled
  *(Backtracking reduces shading between rows during early morning and late afternoon.)*

* **`max_rotation_angle`**: The maximum rotation angle (in degrees) allowed for the tracker

##### System Alignment Notes

Adapt the following parameters based on your system configuration:

* If your tracker rows are aligned **north-south** (most common), set the **`azimuth` or `orientation`** to **180¬∞**
* For systems installed on **flat ground**, set the **`tilt`** to **0¬∞**

In the response of your portfolio you might find additional information that you have not defined e.g. the TSO-Area or a ZIP Code. These information are defined by alitiq.

In case you use the html- Response of the API the systems will be shown in a table like this:

## Delete system from your portfolio

In case you want to delete a pv-system from your portfolio, you can simply use a POST request to the endpoint `pv_systems/delete/` it. Please use your individually defined location_id to delete the system: 

=== "python requests"

    ``` python
    import requests
    
    url = "https://api.alitiq.com/solar/pv_systems/delete/"
    
    querystring = {"location_id": "your-location-id-to-delete"}
    
    payload = ""
    headers = {"x-api-key": {api-key}}
    response = requests.request("POST", url, data=payload, params=querystring, headers=headers)
    
    print(response.text)
    ```

=== "alitiq-py"

    ``` python
    from alitiq import alitiqSolarAPI
    
    # Initialize the API client
    solar_api = alitiqSolarAPI(api_key="your-api-key")
    
    # delete location 
    response = solar_api.delete_location("your-location-id-to_delete")
    print(response.text)
    ```

=== "cURL"

    ``` bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url 'https://api.alitiq.com/solar/pv_systems/delete/?location_id=your-location-id-to_delete' \
      --header 'x-api-key: api-key'
    ```

## FAQs ‚ùì 

### Which temp_factor should I use? 

The **temperature factor** (temp_factor) accounts for the temperature-related efficiency loss of PV systems. Use the appropriate value based on the type of mounting for accurate forecasting.  

| **System Type**        | **Description**                        | **Temp Factor (temp_factor)** |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Free-Mounted Systems    | Modules mounted on open frames with good ventilation | `0.03`                      |
| Roof-Mounted Systems    | Modules mounted on roofs with moderate ventilation | `0.035`                       |
| Roof-Integrated Systems | Modules integrated into the roof with limited ventilation | `0.05`                       |

### What if my power plant has only one subsystem?  
You can omit the `subsystems` field and define the **azimuth**, **tilt**, and **installed_power** at the plant level.  

### Can I update the location later?

Currently not, this feature is under development. Please `delete` the system and re-configure it.
