# How to Check Available Runs with the alitiq Solar API üå§Ô∏è  

The alitiq Solar API allows you to check available forecast runs for your Solar PV systems. This endpoint provides flexibility in choosing a weather model and forecast data, ensuring your needs are met while emphasizing the **OPTIMIZED** weather model for the most accurate predictions.  

---

## Overview  

Forecast runs represent the calculations of solar energy production based on various weather models. You can query which runs are available for a specific Solar PV system and select the model that best suits your application.

| **icon_d2**             | DWD (Germany)      | ICON-D2, a high-resolution short-term forecast model for central Europe.                                |  
| **icon_eu**             | DWD (Germany)      | ICON-EU, a regional weather model offering enhanced resolution for Europe.                              |  
| **icon_global**         | DWD (Germany)      | ICON Global, the global version of the ICON model offering comprehensive coverage.                      |  
| **optimized**           | alitiq             | (Default) Proprietary model combining strengths of various weather sources with historical performance. |  

### Why Use the OPTIMIZED Weather Model?  
The **OPTIMIZED** weather model combines the strengths of various sources and integrates localized performance data, making it our **recommended option**. It represents our best estimate for accurate and reliable solar energy forecasting.

## Required Parameters  

To check available forecast runs, provide the following:  

| **Parameter**   | **Type**           | **Description**                                                           | **Default** |  
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|  
| `location_id`    | `str`             | Unique identifier of the location.                                        | None        |  
| `weather_model`  | `str` (Optional)  | Name of the weather model (e.g., `optimized`, `icon_eu`, `ncep_gfs_025`). | OPTIMIZED   |

## Example: Check Available Runs  

Here‚Äôs how to check available forecast runs using the `forecast/check/` endpoint or the `check_available_runs` method of the python SDK:

=== "python requests"

    ``` python
    import requests
    
    url = "https://api.alitiq.com/solar/forecast/check/"
    
    querystring = {"weather_model":"icon_eu", "location_id": "1", "number_of_runs": 10}
    
    payload = ""
    headers = {"x-api-key": "api-key"}
    
    response = requests.request("GET", url, data=payload, headers=headers, params=querystring)
    
    print(response.text)
    ```

=== "alitiq-py"

    ``` python
    from alitiq import alitiqSolarAPI
    
    # Initialize the API client
    solar_api = alitiqSolarAPI(api_key="your-api-key")
    
    # Define the location ID and optional weather model
    location_id = "SP123"
    
    # Check available forecast runs
    available_runs = solar_api.check_available_runs(location_id=location_id, weather_model="optimized")
    
    # Print the available runs
    print("Available forecast runs:")
    print(available_runs)
    ```

=== "cURL"

    ``` bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url 'https://api.alitiq.com/solar/forecast/check/?weather_model=icon_eu&location_id=1&number_of_runs=10' \
      --header 'x-api-key: api-key'
    ```

## API Response  

The response includes the list of available forecast runs:  

```plaintext
|      run_id      |  dt_run_start   |  dt_forecast_start  | weather_model   |  
|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|  
| 00123456789abcdef | 2024-06-10T08:00| 2024-06-10T10:00    | optimized       |  
| 00123456789ghijkl | 2024-06-10T14:00| 2024-06-10T16:00    | icon-eu         |  
```

## Best Practices  

- **Choose the OPTIMIZED Model**: While other models may suit specific needs, we strongly recommend the **OPTIMIZED** model for its superior accuracy.  
- **Verify Run Availability**: Always check the available runs before attempting to retrieve forecast data to ensure data freshness.  
- **Use Recent Runs**: For better accuracy, use the most recent run available.  

---

## Notes  

- **Custom Weather Models**: Specify other models like `meteofrance_arpege` or `icon-global` if needed for specific comparisons or analyses.  
- **Data Freshness**: New runs are typically generated at regular intervals; check often for updates.  
- **Optimized Performance**: The API is designed to handle large portfolios, ensuring that checking runs for multiple locations is efficient.
